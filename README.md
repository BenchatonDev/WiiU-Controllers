# What is it ?
This is a Controller API for the Wii U game console aiming to simplify the use of the wiiu's native libraries
which as of now, it's basicly Dimok's VPADInput.h and WPADInput.h with access to more controller data, like gyro
accelerometer, etc

# Stuff Planned 
 - Make a header to simplify the use of more complex bits and bobs like The Wii Mote speaker and rumble
 - Make a header to allow specific controller channels to be merge and output a single input object

# Credits
- [DevkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro) They are awsome peeps, without them most Nintendo homebrew wouldn't exist
- [Dimok](https://github.com/dimok789) For making VPADInput.h and WPADInput.h which served as a basis
