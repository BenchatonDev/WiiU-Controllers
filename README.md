# What is it ?
This is a Controller API for the Wii U game console aiming to simplify the use of the wiiu's native libraries
it can, as of now, Create all the input sources up to 8 controllers, rumble the DRC from a simple list of booleans
or from a list of unint8s, merge multiple input object into one !

# Stuff Planned 
 - WORKING ON IT : Make a header to simplify the use of more complex bits and bobs like The Wii Mote speaker and rumble
 - DONE / UNTESTED : Make a header to allow specific controller channels to be merged and output a single input object
